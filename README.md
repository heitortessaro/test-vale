## Manage your contacts

SOLO gives you the ability to have full control over your contact list. You can easily edit any contact by simply changing its name. This will automatically update all transactions associated with that contact, ensuring that your records are always accurate and consistent.

### Merging contacts

You may have multiple contacts in your list that are duplicates or should be combined for better organization. With SOLO, you can merge one contact with another, combining all related transactions under the merged contact. This will streamline your contact list and prevent unnecessary repetition in your records.

To do so, select both contacts you wish to merge, and a side panel will open with the merging process, as presented in the image below:

### Deleting a contact

If you no longer require a contact in your Directory, you can delete it. This helpful feature enables you to maintain a clean and relevant contact list that aligns with your business requirements.

By deleting a contact, SOLO'll restore the transactions linked to it to their original bank narration or leave them unnamed.

## SOLO's smart search

SOLO's Directory comes with a powerful smart search capability. You can use this feature to search for a specific contact by name or by any other relevant criteria. With the smart search, you can save time and easily find contacts, even as your contact list grows.
